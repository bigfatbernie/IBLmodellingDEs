\question We want to model two competing populations, like cheetahs and lions: they don't hunt each other, but they hunt the same prey.
\begin{parts}
	\item Create a model for these two populations.
	\item Using Desmos or WolframAlpha, create a slope field in the plane where the horizontal axis is one population and the vertical one is the other.
	\item Using the slope field, deduce some properties of your model and discuss how closely it matches what you expect from these populations.

	\item Extend the model to include a population of antelopes.	
\end{parts}

\question
	A cheetah is chasing an antelope. We want a model of their positions as they run.
	
	
\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		This exercise is not required to do in lecture.
		
		Allow some brainstorming and try to create a structure for this problem:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Positions seen from above ($xy-$plane).
			\item Only need $x_a(t), y_a(t)$ and $x_c(t), y_c(t)$
			\item Focus on the cheetah: where is she heading to?
			\item For the antelope, students need to come up with an escape strategy
			\item Model will be nonlinear!
		\end{itemize}
	\end{goals}
