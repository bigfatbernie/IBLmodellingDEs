\question We want to model two competing populations, like cheetahs and lions: they don't hunt each other, but they hunt the same prey.
\begin{parts}
	\item Create a model for these two populations.
	\item Using Desmos or WolframAlpha, create a slope field in the plane where the horizontal axis is one population and the vertical one is the other.
	\item Using the slope field, deduce some properties of your model and discuss how closely it matches what you expect from these populations.

	\item Extend the model to include a population of antelopes.

\question
	A cheetah is chasing an antelope. We want a model of their positions as they run.
	
	
\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		This exercise is not required to do in lecture. \\
		
		Be careful with assumptions! A very general model will be very hard to study. \\
		
		Allow some brainstorming and try to create a structure for this problem:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Positions seen from above ($xy-$plane).
			\item Only need $x_a(t), y_a(t)$ and $x_c(t), y_c(t)$
			\item Focus on the cheetah: where is she heading to?
			\item For the antelope, students need to come up with an escape strategy
			\item Model will be nonlinear!

	At the end, let the students know that the equilibrium is called \emph{saddle point} and it is \emph{unstable}, because solutions go away from it.
	
	For the interpretation question, when one population hits zero, it is extinct, so the graph doesn't make sense. 
	
	We can interpret that if a population becomes extinct, then the other will behave as it would without competitors: grow exponentially fast!

\question
	Consider the following model for cheetah's and lions, where
	$$ \vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \ell(t) = \text{population of lions} \\ c(t) = \text{population of cheetahs} \end{bmatrix} $$
	which satisfies
	$$
	\frac{d\,\vec{p}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix}
 		1 & -1 \\
 		-3 & 1
 	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
	
	The general solution is:
	$$
	\vec{p}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1-\sqrt{3})t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1+\sqrt{3})t}.
	$$
\begin{parts}
	\item Without computing them, what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix?
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=\pm 1$ and $c_2=0$.
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=0$ and $c_2=\pm 1$.
	\item When one constant is set to 0, what is the shape of the graph? Is it always like that? Can you prove it?
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=\pm 1$ and $c_2=\pm 1$.
	\item Provide an interpretation of the different types of solutions.

\question
	Let us expand the model from the previous exercise to:
	$$ \vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \ell(t) = \text{population of lions} \\ c(t) = \text{population of cheetahs} \end{bmatrix} $$
	which satisfies
	$$
	\frac{d\,\vec{p}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix}
 		1 & -1 \\
 		-3 & 1
 	\end{bmatrix} \vec{p}
 	+ \begin{bmatrix}
 		- 10 \\ 50
	 \end{bmatrix}.
	$$
	
	The extra term corresponds to the effect of harvesting 10 lions and bringing in 50 cheetahs every year to the reserve. \\
	
	The general solution is:
	$$
	\vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 20 \\ 10 \end{bmatrix} +
		c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1-\sqrt{3})t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1+\sqrt{3})t}.

		\item \emph{sink} and it is \emph{asymptotically stable}, because solutions converge to it.
	\end{itemize}
	
	If there is time, students can think about:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Given a matrix $A$, which part of $A$ indicates whether the equilibrium is stable / unstable? Which part indicates whether it's a sink/source vs spiral sink/source?

\question
	Consider the following model for the sales from a designer clothing brand:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $x_1(t) = $ purchases by ``common mortals'' (CM) at time $t$ in years since the beginning of 2015.
	\item $x_2(t) = $ purchases by ``famous people'' (FP) at time $t$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Our model is based on the following two principles:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={($P_{\arabic*}$)}]
		\item CM will buy more items from the brand when CM or FP buy more.
		\item FP will buy less when CM buy them, but will buy more when FP buy it.
	\end{enumerate}

	The model we considered is:
	$$
	\vec{x}'(t) = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
 		a & b \\
 		-c & d
	\end{bmatrix}
	\vec{x}(t)
	$$
	
	\begin{parts}
		\item Suppose that at the beginning only CM buy this brand. Describe how $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ evolve as $t>0$.


		\item Suppose that at the beginning only FP buy this brand. Describe how $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ evolve as $t>0$.


		\item What conditions on the constants $a,b,c,d$ will guarantee that the solutions will spiral? In that case, is it a spiral source or spiral sink? Is it clockwise or counterclockwise?
		\item Are there constants $a,b,c,d>0$, such that the solution $\vec{x}$ is periodic?
		\item Consider the constants $a=b=c=d=1$. Assume that initially CM were buying $c_0>0$ items and FP were buying $f_0>0$ items.
			What will happen to $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ as $t \to \infty$? Explain the results in terms of the evolution of purchases from CM and FP.
\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		Can leave .6 as a practice problem if there isn't enough time.
	\end{goals}
\end{annotation}
		\item Consider the constants $a=b=c=d=1$.  If $c_0=10$, $f_0=100$, then at what time will FP stop buying items? And at what time will FP be buying the maximum number of items?
