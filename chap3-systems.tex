\question We want to model two competing populations, like cheetahs and lions: they don't hunt each other, but they hunt the same prey.
\begin{parts}
	\item Create a model for these two populations.
	\item Using Desmos or WolframAlpha, create a slope field in the plane where the horizontal axis is one population and the vertical one is the other.
	\item Using the slope field, deduce some properties of your model and discuss how closely it matches what you expect from these populations.

	\item Extend the model to include a population of antelopes.	
\end{parts}

\question
	A cheetah is chasing an antelope. We want a model of their positions as they run.
	
	
\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		This exercise is not required to do in lecture.
		
		Allow some brainstorming and try to create a structure for this problem:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Positions seen from above ($xy-$plane).
			\item Only need $x_a(t), y_a(t)$ and $x_c(t), y_c(t)$
			\item Focus on the cheetah: where is she heading to?
			\item For the antelope, students need to come up with an escape strategy
			\item Model will be nonlinear!

\newpage

\question
	Consider the following model for cheetah's and lions, where
	$$ \vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \ell(t) = \text{population of lions} \\ c(t) = \text{population of cheetahs} \end{bmatrix} $$
	which satisfies
	$$
	\frac{d\,\vec{p}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix}
 		1 & -1 \\
 		-3 & 1
 	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
	
	The general solution is:
	$$
	\vec{p}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1-\sqrt{3})t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1+\sqrt{3})t}.
	$$
\begin{parts}
	\item Without computing them, what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix?
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=\pm 1$ and $c_2=0$.
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=0$ and $c_2=\pm 1$.
	\item When one constant is set to 0, what is the shape of the graph? Is it always like that? Can you prove it?
	\item Sketch the graph of the solution with $c_1=\pm 1$ and $c_2=\pm 1$.
	\item Provide an interpretation of the different types of solutions.
\end{parts}

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
	At the end, let the students know that the equilibrium is called \emph{saddle point} and it is \emph{unstable}, because solutions go away from it.
	
	For the interpretation question, when one population hits zero, it is extinct, so the graph doesn't make sense. 
	
	We can interpret that if a population becomes extinct, then the other will behave as it would without competitors: grow exponentially fast!

\question
	Let us expand the model from the previous exercise to:
	$$ \vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \ell(t) = \text{population of lions} \\ c(t) = \text{population of cheetahs} \end{bmatrix} $$
	which satisfies
	$$
	\frac{d\,\vec{p}}{dt} = \begin{bmatrix}
 		1 & -1 \\
 		-3 & 1
 	\end{bmatrix} \vec{p}
 	+ \begin{bmatrix}
 		- 10 \\ 50
	 \end{bmatrix} \vec{p}.
	$$
	
	The extra term corresponds to the effect of harvesting 10 lions and bringing in 50 cheetahs every year to the reserve. \\
	
	The general solution is:
	$$
	\vec{p}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 20 \\ 10 \end{bmatrix} +
		c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1-\sqrt{3})t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{3} \end{bmatrix} e^{(1+\sqrt{3})t}.
	$$
\begin{parts}
	\item Sketch the phase portrait.
	\item Provide an interpretation of the different types of solutions.
\end{parts}

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		Some students might try to sketch everything from scratch.
		Remind them that the solutions look very similar and they only have to adapt the phase portrait they had before.

\question
	For each of the following general solutions, sketch the phase portrait.
\begin{parts}
	\item $	\vec{r}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{2t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{5t}.$
	\item $	\vec{r}(t) = c_1 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-2t} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} e^{-5t}.$	
\end{parts}
\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
	At the end, let the students know that these equilibria are called 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{source} and it is \emph{unstable}, because solutions go away from it.
		\item \emph{sink} and it is \emph{asymptotically stable}, because solutions converge to it.
	\end{itemize}
	
	If there is time, students can think about:

	Given a matrix $A$, which part of $A$ indicates whether the equilibrium is stable / unstable? Which part indicates whether it's a sink/source vs spiral sink/source?
