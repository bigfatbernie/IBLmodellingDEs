		\prob We have a spring attached to a mass and with a dashpot. 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Model the position of the mass as time changes.
			\item Obtain a system of two first-order ODEs. Remember to explain how the new functions relate to the spring-mass-dashpot system.
		\end{enumerate}

	\prob Model a vehicle with a special engine that provides an acceleration to the car proportional to the fuel left.
	
	\prob Imagine two twin babies and model their crying volume. Assume that they naturally become tired and stop crying if alone, but they cry more if the other twin is crying.
