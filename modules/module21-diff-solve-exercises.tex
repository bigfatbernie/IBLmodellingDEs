	\begin{problist}
	\prob Consider the initial-value problem
	$$ 	\begin{cases}
			 x_{k+1} = 3 x_k + 4 \\
			 x_0 = 1
 		\end{cases} $$
 	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Using the expand-until-you-find-the-pattern technique, find the solution of this problem.
 		\item Observe that this problem has an equilibrium solution $x^\star$. What is $x^\star$?
 		\item Define a new sequence $y_k = x_k - x^\star$. Which initial-value problem does ti satisfy?
 		\item Find $y_k$.
 		\item Find $x_k$.
 	\end{enumerate}

	\prob When we were solving ODEs, we considered exponential solutions of the form $u_k = e^{rk}$, but above we considered $u_k = r^k$. Are these equivalent?
	
	Consider the initial-value problem
	$$ 	\begin{cases}
			 x_{k+1} = x_{k} - x_{k-1} \\
			 x_0 = 1 \\
			 x_1 = 2
 		\end{cases} $$

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Solve the problem assuming the solution is of the form $u_k = r^k$.
		\item Solve the problem assuming the solution is of the form $u_k=e^{rk}$.
		\item What can you conclude?
	\end{enumerate}

	\prob Find the solution to the problem
	$$ 	\begin{cases}
			 x_{k+1} = -2x_{k} - x_{k-1} \\
			 x_0 = 1 \\
			 x_1 = 2
 		\end{cases} $$
