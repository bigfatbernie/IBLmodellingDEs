	\begin{problist}
	\prob Solve the differential equation $\displaystyle \ln(t) y' + \frac{1}{t}y = 3$.
	
	\prob Decide whether the following differential equations are separable, first-order linear, both, or neither. If they are of one type, solve it.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\displaystyle (t^2+4) y'(t) = \frac{2t}{y^2}$
		\item $\displaystyle \frac{1}{t^2} y'(t) = 2$

		\item $\displaystyle y'(t) = t + y$
		\item $\displaystyle y'(t) = t + y^2$
		\item $\displaystyle y'(t) = \frac{t}{y}$
		\item $\displaystyle y'(t) = -\frac{1}{t} y$
		\item $\displaystyle y'(t) = 1 - 4t - \frac5t y$

		\item $\displaystyle e^{-t} y'(t) - e^{-t} y = 3e^{2t}$
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\prob Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Give an explanation or a counterexample.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item There are differential equations that are both separable and first-order linear.
		\item There are differential equations that are separable, but are not first-order linear.
		\item There are differential equations that are first-order linear, but not separable.
		\item There are first-order differential equations that are neither separable nor linear.
		\item All first-order linear differential equations have solutions defined in the whole real line.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\prob Consider the differential equation
	$$ y' - \frac{y}{2(x+4)} = \frac{1}{2(x+4)} $$
	\begin{enumerate}
