	\begin{problist}
	\prob Create a model for the following situation:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item You just took a loan to buy a car. You'll need to make fixed payments every period, and the bank will charge an interest on the amount you still owe every period.

		\item A bird is chirping to find a mate. Unfortunately it is standing next to a cave which echoes its chirps. Consider the following:

 
			\begin{enumerate}[label={(P$_{\arabic*}$) } ]
			\item The bird chirps once every minute;
			\item The maximum volume the bird can chirp is $M$ dB;
			\item If it hears a chirp, then it chirps at a volume proportional to the volume of the chirp it heard times the difference between the maximum volume it is capable and the volume heard with constant $A \ \frac{1}{dB}$;
			\end{enumerate}



		\item IBM just developed an new software that they wish to charge for usage. In this program, there is a parameter $n$ that you can choose to change how it performs:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item $n^2 = $ number of operations it takes to run the program;
	%		\item Each operation takes $10^{-3}$ seconds;
	%		\item The error of the result is inversely proportional to $n$, i.e., proportional to $\frac1n$;
			\item The profit IBM will make is $- \ln({\rm error})$ in Canadian dollars (negative means that IBM has to pay a penalty).
			\end{itemize}
	
			Model the profit that IBM makes. Remember to consider all sources of costs.
	
		\item Let us study Engineering students at the University of Toronto. Find a model for the number of undergraduate students in the Engineering school at the University of Toronto and how they change from year to year. 

		\item You are working for Canada Revenue Agency and the queue in the IRS complaints section is getting too large and lengthy. One way to solve this would be to stop collecting taxes, but that's not possible, so you are tasked with modelling the queue. 

			Model a queue on a typical weekday afternoon minute by minute. 
%			Here are some details about the queue:
%			\begin{itemize}
%			\item The average number of people joining the queue per minute is $\beta$.
%			\item On average, $\gamma\%$ of people in the queue are attended and leave the queue per minute.
%			\item Also on average $\mu\%$ of people in the queue give up waiting and leave the queue per minute.
%			\end{itemize}
