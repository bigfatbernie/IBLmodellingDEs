	\prob Consider a mountain with shape $y=f(x)$ a hiker who is climbing down the mountain with horizontal position $x(t)$. She starts at a peak of the mountain at $x_0=0$. As she climbs down the mountain, she notices that from her point-of-view, the rate of change of the slope of the mountain is decreasing linearly with time.
		The hiker also notices that her horizontal speed is constant.
	
		Model the hiker's position and the shape of the mountain.
