\section*{About the Document}


This document is a mix of student resources, student projects, problem sets, and labs. 
A typical class day looks like:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Preparation by students.} Students prepare for lecture by watching a short video and solving a short quiz. 

	\item \textbf{Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.

	\item \textbf{Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in small groups
		on the prescribed problem. During this time the instructor moves
		around the room addressing questions that students may have and giving
		one-on-one coaching.

	\item \textbf{Instructor intervention.} If most students have successfully solved
		the problem, the instructor regroups the class by providing a concise
		explanation so that everyone is ready to move to the next concept.
		This is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has
		understood the main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes
		easy to do some computation while being oblivious to the larger context).

		If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints to
		the group, and additional guidance to ensure the students don't get
		frustrated to the point of giving up.

	\item \textbf{Repeat step 2.}
\end{enumerate}

Using this format, students are working (and happily so) most of the class. Further,
they are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor, having already
invested substantially into each problem.

This problem-set is geared towards concepts instead of computation, though some problems
focus on simple computation.

\section*{Step A. Defining the problem}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step A. Defining the problem}

The first step is to define the problem we want to solve or improve.

To do this, we should start from the end! We need to decide on what kind of mathematical object we will use in the end to show that we solved, or at least improved, the problem we were tasked with. \\


Once this is done, we can define the problem mathematically. 

\begin{example}
	Your team was tasked with optimizing the layout of an airport.
	
	You decided that in the end, to show that the team did find a good layout fo an airport, they will show
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $T = $ the total time (in minutes) necessary by the average person to walk from their airport transportation (taxi, train, bus) to their gate.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Once this decision is made, the problem to solve (or improve) becomes the following:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minimize $T$
	\end{itemize}

	There will probably be some constraints, which will be studied in Step C.

\end{example}

For each part, what ``mathematical object'' would you use to communicate that you have solved or improved the problem? Then define the problem mathematically.
\begin{parts}
	\item Help the city of Toronto choose the best recycling centre.
	\item Help the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) estimate how significant the outbreak of illnesses will be in the coming year in Canada.
	\item Create a mathematical model to rank roller coasters according to thrill factor.
	\item Gas stations offer different prices for gas. I would like to create an app that finds the best gas station to go to. What should ``best'' mean?
	\item The mayor of Toronto wants to extend the subway line with a new \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{blue line} as in Figure \ref{TTC}. Is it optimal?
	
	\item Is it better to buy or rent? 
	\begin{enumerate}

\section*{Step B. Building a mind map}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step B. Building a mind map}

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students usually come up with more complicated variations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Money spent on late employees' salaries
			\item sum of time in minutes that employees are late counting only employees that are at most 15 minutes late
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stick with $R$, a simple first approach
	\end{itemize}	
	\end{notes}
	
\end{annotation}


A mind map is a tool to visually outline and organize ideas. Typically a key idea is the centre of a mind map and associated ideas are added to create a diagram that shows the flow of ideas. In Figure \ref{mindmap1}, we focus on the definition of ``best'', with three possible definitions
branching off to be further explored. From here, we can focus our attention on one of the three branches
at a time.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\fill[color=Green] (0,0) rectangle (4,1) node[pos=.5] {\color{black}``Best'' recycling centre};
	\fill[color=BurntOrange] (7,2.5) rectangle (11,1.5) node[pos=.5] {\color{black}Most participation};
	\fill[color=Goldenrod] (7,0) rectangle (11,1) node[pos=.5] {\color{black}Least cost to the city};
	\fill[color=red] (7,-1.5) rectangle (12,-0.5) node[pos=.5] {\color{black}Processes the most recyclables};
	\draw (4,0.75) -- (7,2);
	\draw (4,0.5) -- (7,0.5);
	\draw (4,0.25) -- (7,-1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An example of a simple mind map.}
\label{mindmap1}
\end{figure}


Let's think about the least-cost option first. We probably can't determine how much any recycling program costs without knowing more about the recycling program, so a good place to start is to ask the question ``What kinds of recycling programs exist?''
If we aren't familiar with different types of recycling, we might need to do some research to see what kinds of programs exist.


A possible next step on your mind map for the least-cost approach could be the one shown in Figure \ref{mindmap2}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\fill[color=Green] (0,0) rectangle (4,1) node[pos=.5] {\color{black}``Best'' recycling centre};

\section*{Step D. Parameters or Variables?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step D. Parameters or Variables?}


%There is a clear difference between \emph{variables} and \emph{parameters}. 

\begin{definition}[Variables and Parameters]

A \emph{variable} represents a model state, and may change during simulation.

A \emph{parameter} is commonly used to describe objects statically. A \emph{parameter} is normally a constant in a single simulation, and is changed only when you need to adjust your model behaviour. 
\end{definition}

%Use a variable instead of a parameter if you need to model some data unit continuously changing over time. Use a parameter instead of a variable if you just need to model some parameter of an object changed only at particular moments of time.



\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
	\qrcode{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter\#Mathematical\_models}	
	\end{goals}
\end{annotation}
\begin{note}{(from Wikipedia)}
The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into variables and parameters. The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on the context in which the variables appear. 

Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the \emph{variables} of the model. 

To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces ``constants'' which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the \emph{parameters}.	
\end{note}









The choice of question in the previous lesson should determine the \emph{dependent} variable.

%
%The \emph{parameters} are the independent variables in the problem, e.g. the speed of the elevators. The final answer will depend on the parameters in the problem. 
%
%We can estimate the parameters, and sometimes even change them. \\
%
%The \emph{variables} are dependent. This meant that if we change the parameters, the variables will change automatically.

	\item Personnel is distributed in the following way: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 350 employees in floor 30,
		\item 350 employees in floor 31,
		\item 250 employees in floor 32, 
		\item 150 employees in floor 33.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textsl{Note.} Even though these details are fictional, the numbers respect the building code.


\subparagraph{Tasks.} Focus on a \textbf{few} parameters and variables. State hypotheses.

\begin{enumerate} 

	\item With your team, decide on what kind of information you would need to have to be able to solve this problem.

	\item Find the relevant information about the elevators (search the internet, by experimentation). Check the reliability of the data you found.

	\item For the relevant information that you cannot obtain, make assumptions. These assumptions should be reasonable and you should be able to justify them.

	\Heading{Textbook} Section 1.1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Internalize vectors as geometric objects representing displacements.

		\item Use column vector notation to write vectors.

		\item Relate points an vectors and be able to interpret a point as
			a vector and a vector as a point.

		\item Solve simple equations involving vectors.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Students have differing levels of experience with vectors.
	We want to establish a common notation for vectors and use vector notation
	along with algebra to solve simple questions. E.g., ``How can I get to location
	$A$ given that I can only walk parallel to the lines $y=4x$ and $y=-x$?''


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item
			We will use the language \emph{component of $\vec v$ in
			the direction $\vec u$} in the future and it will be a \emph{vector}.
			For this reason, try to refer to the entries of a column
			vector as \emph{coordinates} or \emph{entries} instead of components.

			\item
			Though we will almost exclusively use
			column vector notation in this course, students should be able to parse
			questions phrased in terms of row vectors.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	
	We will use column vector notation and the idea of equating
	coordinates in order to solve problems.

You are a young traveler, leaving home for the first time. Your parents
want to help you on your journey, so just before your departure, they give you two
gifts. Specifically, they give you two forms of transportation: a hover board and
a magic carpet. Your parents inform you that both the hover board and the magic carpet
have restrictions in how they operate:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/HoverBoard-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the hover board's movement by the vector
	$\mat{3 \\1}$. By this we mean that if
	the hover board traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 3 miles East and
	1 mile North of its starting location.

% Scenario Section
\textbf{Scenario One: The Maiden Voyage}

Your Uncle Cramer suggests that your first adventure should be to go visit
the wise man, Old Man Gauss. Uncle Cramer tells you that Old Man Gauss
lives in a cabin that is 107 miles East and 64 miles North of your home.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Task:}
\par
Investigate whether or not you can use the hover board and the magic
carpet to get to Gauss's cabin. If so, how? If it is not possible to
get to the cabin with these modes of transportation, why is that the case?

%\vspace{5mm}
% As a group, state and explain your answer(s) on the group whiteboard. Use
% the vector notation for each mode of transportation as part of your
% explanation and use a diagram or graphic to help illustrate your
% point(s).


\begin{lesson}
	\Title{Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Section 1.2

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set up and solve vector equations $a\vec v+b\vec u=\vec w$. The solving
			method may be ad hoc.
		\item Use set notation and set operations/relations $\cup$, $\cap$, $\in$, $\subseteq$.
		\item Translate between set-builder notation and words in multiple ways.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	We revisit questions about linear combinations more formally and generate a need for
	algebra. The algebra we do to solve vector equations will become algorithmic when
	we learn row reduction, but at the moment, any method is fine.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			You will have a mix of MAT135/136 and MAT137 students.
			The MAT137 students will be doing logic and sets in their
			class. The MAT135 students won't. Make sure not to leave them
			behind!

	As we talk about more complex objects, we need precise ways to talk about
	groups of vectors. I.e., we need sets and set-builder notation. This preview of set-builder
	notation will take some of difficulty away when we define span as a set of vectors.

	In this course we will be using formal and precise language. Part of this lesson
	is that there are multiple correct ways (and multiple incorrect ways) to use formal
	language. Gone are the days of ``there's only one right answer and it is 4''!

\section*{Sets and Set Notation}
\vspace{-.5cm}

	\begin{definition}[Set]
		A \emph{set} is a (possibly infinite) collection of items
		and is notated with curly braces (for example, $\{1,2,3\}$ is
		the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3).  We call the items in
		a set \emph{elements}.

		If $X$ is a set and $a$ is an element of $X$, we may write $a\in X$,
		which is read ``$a$ is an element of $X$.''

		If $X$ is a set, a \emph{subset} $Y$ of $X$ (written $Y\subseteq X$)
		is a set such that every element of $Y$ is an element of $X$. Two sets are
		called \emph{equal} if they are subsets of each other (i.e., $X=Y$ if
		$X\subseteq Y$ and $Y\subseteq X$).

		We can define a subset using \emph{set-builder notation}.
		That is, if $X$ is a set, we can define the subset
		\[
			Y= \Set*{a\in X \given \text{some rule involving }a},
		\]
		which is read ``$Y$ is the set of $a$ in $X$ {\bf such that} some rule
		involving $a$ is true.''  If $X$ is intuitive, we may omit it and
		simply write $Y=\{a:\text{some rule involving }a\}$.  You may equivalently
		use ``$|$'' instead of ``$:$'', writing $Y=\{a\,|\,\text{some rule involving }a\}$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}
		Some common sets are
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] $\N=\Set{\text{natural numbers}} = \Set{\text{non-negative whole numbers}}$.

				\]
				Therefore any vector in $\R^2$ can be written as linear combinations

		\item Can you find a vector in $\R^2$ that isn't a linear combination of
			$\vec v_1$?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. All linear combinations of $\vec v_1$ have equal $x$ and
				$y$ coordinates, therefore $\vec w=\mat{2\\1}$ is not a linear
				combination of $\vec v_1$.

	\Heading{Textbook} Section 1.2

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read and digest a new definition.

		\item Use pictures to explore a new concept.

		\item Convert from an equation-representation of a line to a set-representation.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Part of doing math in the world is reading and understanding
	other people's definitions. Most students will not have heard of non-negative
	linear combinations or convex linear combinations. This is a chance for them
	to read and try to understand these formal definitions. They will need to
	draw pictures to get an intuition about what these concepts mean.

	These concepts are useful in their own right, and in particular, convex linear
	combinations can be used to describe line segments. Adding these definitions
	to a student's toolbox serves the goal of \emph{being able to describe
	the world with mathematics}.

	To that end, we start working with lines. Lines are something students have
	used since grade school, but they worked with them in $y=mx+b$ form which
	is only applicable in $\R^{2}$. We want to convert this representation
	into vector form and set-based descriptions which apply to all
	dimensions.

	\begin{definition}[Non-negative \& Convex Linear Combinations]
		The linear combination $\vec w=\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2+\cdots+\alpha_n\vec v_n$ is
		called a \emph{non-negative} linear combination of $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n$ if
		$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq 0$.

		If $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq 0$
		and $\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\cdots+\alpha_n=1$, then $\vec w$ is called a \emph{convex} linear combination
	of  $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n$.

				\item Gain geometric intuition for non-negative and convex linear

				\item Learn how to describe line segments using

				\item They know $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ span all vectors from problem \ref{ProbSkewBasis}.
				\item In part 1, they will forget $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ are linear combinations of themselves.
				\item Part 2 (b) highlights a degeneracy that will come up again when discussing linear independence and dependence. Explain how the
