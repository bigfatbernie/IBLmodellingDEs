\begin{module}
	\Title{Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook} Section 1.1

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Internalize vectors as geometric objects representing displacements.

		\item Use column vector notation to write vectors.

		\item Relate points an vectors and be able to interpret a point as
			a vector and a vector as a point.

		\item Solve simple equations involving vectors.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Students have differing levels of experience with vectors.
	We want to establish a common notation for vectors and use vector notation
	along with algebra to solve simple questions. E.g., ``How can I get to location
	$A$ given that I can only walk parallel to the lines $y=4x$ and $y=-x$?''


	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item
			We will use the language \emph{component of $\vec v$ in
			the direction $\vec u$} in the future and it will be a \emph{vector}.
			For this reason, try to refer to the entries of a column
			vector as \emph{coordinates} or \emph{entries} instead of components.

			\item
			Though we will almost exclusively use
			column vector notation in this course, students should be able to parse
			questions phrased in terms of row vectors.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	
	We will use column vector notation and the idea of equating
	coordinates in order to solve problems.

You are a young traveler, leaving home for the first time. Your parents
want to help you on your journey, so just before your departure, they give you two
gifts. Specifically, they give you two forms of transportation: a hover board and
a magic carpet. Your parents inform you that both the hover board and the magic carpet
have restrictions in how they operate:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/HoverBoard-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the hover board's movement by the vector
	$\mat{3 \\1}$. By this we mean that if
	the hover board traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 3 miles East and
	1 mile North of its starting location.
\end{minipage}

	\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{1in}
	\vspace{-.8cm}
	\includegraphics[width=1in]{images/MagicCarpet-small.png}
	\end{wrapfigure}

	We denote the restriction on the magic carpet's movement by the vector
	$\mat{1 \\2 }$. By this we mean that if the
	magic carpet traveled ``forward'' for one hour, it would move along a
	``diagonal'' path that would result in a displacement of 1 mile East and
	2 miles North of its starting location.

% Scenario Section
\textbf{Scenario One: The Maiden Voyage}

Your Uncle Cramer suggests that your first adventure should be to go visit
the wise man, Old Man Gauss. Uncle Cramer tells you that Old Man Gauss
lives in a cabin that is 107 miles East and 64 miles North of your home.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Task:}
\par
Investigate whether or not you can use the hover board and the magic
carpet to get to Gauss's cabin. If so, how? If it is not possible to
get to the cabin with these modes of transportation, why is that the case?

%\vspace{5mm}
% As a group, state and explain your answer(s) on the group whiteboard. Use
% the vector notation for each mode of transportation as part of your
% explanation and use a diagram or graphic to help illustrate your
% point(s).


\begin{module}
	\Title{Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}
	Section 1.2

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set up and solve vector equations $a\vec v+b\vec u=\vec w$. The solving
			method may be ad hoc.
		\item Use set notation and set operations/relations $\cup$, $\cap$, $\in$, $\subseteq$.
		\item Translate between set-builder notation and words in multiple ways.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation}
	We revisit questions about linear combinations more formally and generate a need for
	algebra. The algebra we do to solve vector equations will become algorithmic when
	we learn row reduction, but at the moment, any method is fine.

	\begin{annotation}
		\begin{notes}
			You will have a mix of MAT135/136 and MAT137 students.
			The MAT137 students will be doing logic and sets in their
			class. The MAT135 students won't. Make sure not to leave them
			behind!
		\end{notes}
	\end{annotation}
	As we talk about more complex objects, we need precise ways to talk about
	groups of vectors. I.e., we need sets and set-builder notation. This preview of set-builder
	notation will take some of difficulty away when we define span as a set of vectors.

	In this course we will be using formal and precise language. Part of this module
	is that there are multiple correct ways (and multiple incorrect ways) to use formal
	language. Gone are the days of ``there's only one right answer and it is 4''!

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{goals}
		\Goal{Address an existential question involving vectors: ``Is it possible
		to find a linear combination that does\ldots?''}

		The goal of this problem is to
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Formalize geometric questions using the language of vectors.
			\item Find both geometric and algebraic arguments to support the same
				conclusion.
			\item Establish what a ``negative multiple'' of a vector should be.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{goals}
	\begin{notes}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Both \emph{yes} and \emph{no} are valid answers to
				this question depending on whether you are allowed
				to go backwards. Establish that ``negative'' multiples of
				a vector mean traveling backwards along that vector.
			\item This problem can be solved with algebra by finding a formula
				for the coefficients for an arbitrary position or with geometry,
				with arguments eventually hinging on the fact that non-parallel
				lines do not intersect.

\textbf{Scenario Two: Hide-and-Seek}

Old Man Gauss wants to move to a cabin in a different location. You are
not sure whether Gauss is just trying to test your wits at finding him
or if he actually wants to hide somewhere that you can't visit him.

\vspace{5mm}

\textbf{Are there some locations that he can hide and you cannot reach him
with these two modes of transportation?}

Describe the places that you
can reach using a combination of the hover board and the magic carpet and
those you cannot. Specify these geometrically and algebraically. Include
a symbolic representation using vector notation. Also, include a convincing
argument supporting your answer.

%group's whiteboard as a space to write out our work as your work together

\section*{Sets and Set Notation}
\vspace{-.5cm}

	\begin{definition}[Set]
		A \emph{set} is a (possibly infinite) collection of items
		and is notated with curly braces (for example, $\{1,2,3\}$ is
		the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3).  We call the items in
		a set \emph{elements}.

		If $X$ is a set and $a$ is an element of $X$, we may write $a\in X$,
		which is read ``$a$ is an element of $X$.''

		If $X$ is a set, a \emph{subset} $Y$ of $X$ (written $Y\subseteq X$)
		is a set such that every element of $Y$ is an element of $X$. Two sets are
		called \emph{equal} if they are subsets of each other (i.e., $X=Y$ if
		$X\subseteq Y$ and $Y\subseteq X$).

		We can define a subset using \emph{set-builder notation}.
		That is, if $X$ is a set, we can define the subset
		\[
			Y= \Set*{a\in X \given \text{some rule involving }a},
		\]
		which is read ``$Y$ is the set of $a$ in $X$ {\bf such that} some rule
		involving $a$ is true.''  If $X$ is intuitive, we may omit it and
		simply write $Y=\{a:\text{some rule involving }a\}$.  You may equivalently
		use ``$|$'' instead of ``$:$'', writing $Y=\{a\,|\,\text{some rule involving }a\}$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}
		Some common sets are
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] $\N=\Set{\text{natural numbers}} = \Set{\text{non-negative whole numbers}}$.
			\item[] $\Z=\Set{\text{integers}} = \Set{\text{whole numbers, including negatives}}$.
			\item[] $\R=\Set{\text{real numbers}}$.

	\Title{Visualizing Sets, Formal Language of Linear Combinations}

	\Heading{Textbook}

	\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Draw pictures of formally-described subsets of $\R^2$.
		\item Graphically represent $\cup$ and $\cap$ for subsets of $\R^2$.

	\Heading{Motivation}

	We want to build a bridge between the formal language of linear combinations
	and set-builder notation and geometric intuition. Where as last time
	the focus was on formal language, this time the focus is on linking geometry
	to formal descriptions.

	Let $\vec v_1=\mat{1\\1}$, $\vec v_2=\mat{1\\-1}$, and $\vec w=2\vec v_1+\vec v_2$.
	\begin{parts}
		\item Write $\vec w$ as a column vector. When $\vec w$ is written as a
			linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$, what are the
			coefficients of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}
				$\vec w=\mat{3\\2}$; the coefficients are $(2,1)$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $\mat{3\\3}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\mat{3\\3}=3\vec v_1+0\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}

		\item Is $\mat{0\\0}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\vec 0=0\vec v_1+0\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Is $\mat{4\\0}$ a linear combination of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}[inline]
				Yes. $\mat{4\\0}=2\vec v_1+2\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Can you find a vector in $\R^2$ that isn't a linear combination of
		$\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$?
			\begin{solution}
				No. $\mat{1\\0}=\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1+\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2$ and
				$\mat{0\\1}=\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1-\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2$.
				Therefore
				\[
					\mat{a\\b}
					= a\mat{1\\0}+b\mat{0\\1}
					= a(\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1+\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2)
						+b(\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_1-\tfrac{1}{2}\vec v_2)
					=(\tfrac{a+b}{2})\vec v_1+(\tfrac{a-b}{2})\vec v_2.
				\]
				Therefore any vector in $\R^2$ can be written as linear combinations
				of $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$.
			\end{solution}
		\item Can you find a vector in $\R^2$ that isn't a linear combination of
			$\vec v_1$?
			\begin{solution}
				Yes. All linear combinations of $\vec v_1$ have equal $x$ and
				$y$ coordinates, therefore $\vec w=\mat{2\\1}$ is not a linear
				combination of $\vec v_1$.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read and digest a new definition.

		\item Use pictures to explore a new concept.

		\item Convert from an equation-representation of a line to a set-representation.
	\end{itemize}

	\Heading{Motivation} Part of doing math in the world is reading and understanding
	other people's definitions. Most students will not have heard of non-negative
	linear combinations or convex linear combinations. This is a chance for them
	to read and try to understand these formal definitions. They will need to
	draw pictures to get an intuition about what these concepts mean.

	These concepts are useful in their own right, and in particular, convex linear
	combinations can be used to describe line segments. Adding these definitions
	to a student's toolbox serves the goal of \emph{being able to describe
	the world with mathematics}.

	To that end, we start working with lines. Lines are something students have
	used since grade school, but they worked with them in $y=mx+b$ form which
	is only applicable in $\R^{2}$. We want to convert this representation
	into vector form and set-based descriptions which apply to all
	dimensions.

	\begin{definition}[Non-negative \& Convex Linear Combinations]
		The linear combination $\vec w=\alpha_1\vec v_1+\alpha_2\vec v_2+\cdots+\alpha_n\vec v_n$ is
		called a \emph{non-negative} linear combination of $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n$ if
		$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq 0$.

		If $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq 0$
		and $\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\cdots+\alpha_n=1$, then $\vec w$ is called a \emph{convex} linear combination
	of  $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n$.

				\begin{solution}
					Impossible. If $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ are non-negative
