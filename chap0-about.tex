\section*{About the Document}


This document is a mix of student resources, student projects, problem sets, and labs. 
A typical class day looks like:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Preparation by students.} Students prepare for lecture by watching a short video and solving a short quiz. 

	\item \textbf{Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.

	\item \textbf{Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in small groups
		on the prescribed problem. During this time the instructor moves
		around the room addressing questions that students may have and giving
		one-on-one coaching.

	\item \textbf{Instructor intervention.} If most students have successfully solved
		the problem, the instructor regroups the class by providing a concise
		explanation so that everyone is ready to move to the next concept.
		This is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has
		understood the main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes
		easy to do some computation while being oblivious to the larger context).

		If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints to
		the group, and additional guidance to ensure the students don't get
		frustrated to the point of giving up.

	\item \textbf{Repeat step 2.}
\end{enumerate}

Using this format, students are working (and happily so) most of the class. Further,
they are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor, having already
invested substantially into each problem.

This problem-set is geared towards concepts instead of computation, though some problems
focus on simple computation.
