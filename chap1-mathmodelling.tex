\begin{topic}[Mathematical Modelling]
%\Title{Mathematical Modelling}

\label{chap1}
In this section, we study some strategies to model problems mathematically in an effective manner.

We also provide a structure to modelling problems by breaking them in small parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\bf \arabic*.}]
	\item \hyperref[moddefine]{Define the problem}
	\item \hyperref[mindmap]{Build a mind map}
	\item \hyperref[assumption]{Make assumptions}
%	\item \hyperref[D-parvsvar]{Decide on your parameters and variables}
	\item \hyperref[model]{Construct a model}
	\item \hyperref[analysis]{Analyze the model}
	\item \hyperref[report]{Write a report}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{notes}	
\end{annotation}

Students have heard the words ``Model'' and ``Modelling'', yet they don't have a good idea what it means. 

The goal of this first chapter is to establish a common procedure to approach all  (or at least most) modelling tasks. 

The very first step in the procedure is to \emph{define the problem} in a clear and Mathematical way.

In this step, students are supposed to brainstorm and relate the problem at hand with everything that is affected or can be affected by it.

The idea is to get a simple visual representation of possible solutions, without all the details. \\

\label{elevatorR}
Consider the elevator problem from question \ref{elevator-define}.


\begin{annotation}
	\begin{notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students usually come up with more complicated variations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Money spent on late employees' salaries
			\item sum of time in minutes that employees are late counting only employees that are at most 15 minutes late
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stick with $T$, a simple first approach
	\end{itemize}	
	\end{notes}
	
\end{annotation}
Your team decides that the mathematical object you will use to show the CEO that you solved or improved the problem is
\begin{itemize}
	\item $T=$ the sum in minutes by which every employee is late.
\end{itemize}

Note that employees that are on time count for 0 minutes (not a negative amount of minutes). \\

Create a mind map for the question: \quad How can $T$ be minimized?

\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The third step is to decide on a path to the solution and start making assumptions.
		
		\item This is a difficult balance between:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accuracy, but difficult to analyze/solve;
			\item Simple, easy to analyze/solve but not very accurate.
		\end{itemize}

	\item Make sure assumptions and conditions of the modelling are clearly mentioned to the future reader/user of the model
	\end{itemize}
	
	
\Heading{Motivation} 

Students often make assumptions explicitly and implicitly, but they often keep them out of their notes. In the end they forget to include them in the final report.

\begin{annotation}
\begin{goals}
	\Goal{Assumptions.}
	Include the assumptions in the model's final report.

It is imperative that they include their assumptions in the final report of their model.

Moreover, students should make an effort to find out the implicit assumptions and the conditions that to the model that their assumptions require.

				\item How much time do elevators take in each floor?
				\item How many floors do elevators stop on their way up?
				\item How many people fit in the elevator?

\Heading{Textbook} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Module 5

\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item After creating a model, students should make an analysis of the model
		\item The analysis is meant to test the model as well as obtain some of its consequences
		\item If there is a solution to the model, here is where it can be found and analyzed
	\end{itemize}
	

\Heading{Motivation} 

Once a model is created, one must check if the model solves the problem it is meant to solve.
There are different types of assessment for a model:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Check some known cases to see if it works as expected;
	\item Check some extreme cases to see if it works as expected;
	\item Check some implications of the model to make sure they are reasonable;
	\item Check that the assumptions made are reasonable for the problem at hand;
	\item If possible, use approximation methods to estimate the solution;
	\item If possible, find the solution and analyze it.

	\item Loading time of people at ground floor = 20 s
	\item Speed of uninterrupted ascent/descent = 1.5 floors/s
	\item Stop time at a floor = 7 s
	\item Number of elevators serving floors 30--33 = 8

	(these elevators serve floors 23-33 = 11 floors)
	
	\item Maximal capacity of elevators = 25 people
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Personnel that should start at time $t$, arrive uniformly in the interval $[t-30, t-5]$ in minutes
	\item First arrived, first served
	\item During morning rush hour, elevators don't stop on the way down
	\item Elevators stop only at half the floors they serve
	\item Elevator failures are neglected
	\item Mean number of people per floor is equal to the mean number of people per floor of the BigCompany
	\item Elevators are filled, in average, to 80\% of their capacity
\end{itemize}

	\Goal{First make sure model works. Then try to find a solution.}
	Notice that the model doesn't attempt to find a solution to the question. \\
	
	If there weren't any problems with this model, we could then start asking other questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How can we get people in their office faster? 
		\item How will each idea affect the estimate?
		\item Will they cost money to the company?
	\end{itemize}
\end{goals}
\end{annotation}
\textbf{Model:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mean number of people per floor $= d = \dfrac{350+350+250+150}{4} = 275$ people / floor
	\item Number of people on floors served by elevators (11 floors) $= N = d \cdot 11 = 3025$ people
	\item Time $\Delta t$ of one trip

\hfil $\Delta t \quad = \quad $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{loading time on}\\\text{ground floor}}$} 
		$ \;+ \;$ \framebox{$\substack{\text{time of flight}\\\text{ground $\to 33$}}$}
		$ \;+\; $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{time of flight}\\\text{$33 \to$ ground}}$}
		$\;+\; $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{stop time to}\\\text{6 of the 11 floors}}$} $\quad = \quad$ 106 s
		
		\item Number of trips necessary per elevator $= n = \dfrac{3025}{20 \cdot 8} \approx 19$ trips

		\item Time necessary to carry the staff of the BigCompany $= \pmb{t} = \dfrac{19 \cdot 106}{60} = 33 $ minutes
		
		\item Accumulated late time $ = \pmb{T} = 180 \cdot 20 \cdot 8 + 74 \cdot 20 \cdot 8 = 40\,640$ seconds $= $ 11h18m

Your task is to assess this ``model'' (first estimate of the number of minutes employees are late). Be ready to report on your assessment.

\begin{teamwork}
Each team should have \emph{one} assessment and be prepared to present it to the class.

		\item Module 6
	\end{itemize}

\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students practice writing a ``technical'' report
	\end{itemize}
	

\Heading{Motivation} 

Writing technical reports requires practice and students haven't had to do this before.


Some time can be devoted to this in lecture or tutorial, but if that's the case, then students must write a short report before the class and bring it with them. 


\begin{annotation}
\begin{goals}
	\Goal{PAR}

\end{goals}	
\end{annotation}
In class, the instructor can use the \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40753-015-0005-y}{Peer-Assisted Reflection (PAR)} format of Daniel Reinholz as in the example in the next two pages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Students bring their report (1 page);
	\item Students self assess their own work: students check off the icons for things you think you did well and circle the icons for things they would like feedback on;
	\item In class students exchange reports and write feedback to each other;
	\item Students go home and revise their report and submit it online.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note:} Students are also not practiced at giving good feedback, so although the PAR rubric helps mitigate this, we recommend that the instructor spends some lecture/tutorial time showing an example of a question and different answers where students can practice giving good feedback.


\Heading{Preparation for Class}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Read textbook;
	\item In teams of 2--4, write a short report on a modelling problem (e.g. see next two pages).
