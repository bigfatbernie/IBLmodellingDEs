\begin{topic}[Mathematical Modelling]
%\Title{Mathematical Modelling}


In this section, we study some strategies to model problems mathematically in an effective manner.

We also provide a structure to modelling problems by breaking them in small parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label={\bf \arabic*.}]
	\item \hyperref[define]{Define the problem}
	\item \hyperref[mindmap]{Build a mind map}
	\item \hyperref[assumption]{Make assumptions}
%	\item \hyperref[D-parvsvar]{Decide on your parameters and variables}
	\item \hyperref[model]{Construct a model}
	\item \hyperref[analysis]{Analysis of the model}
	\item \hyperref[report]{Writing a report}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{2cm}

In this chapter, we follow the approach of Bliss, Fowler, and Galluzzo from

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The first step in Mathematical modelling is to define the problem
		\item A good way to do this is to figure out what is the ``mathematical object'' we are looking for at the end of the process

		\item The second step is to create a mind map of the problem. This is a structured way to brainstorm possible solutions and their requirements.

Consider the elevator problem from question \ref{elevator-define}.


\begin{annotation}
	\begin{notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students usually come up with more complicated variations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Money spent on late employees' salaries
			\item sum of time in minutes that employees are late counting only employees that are at most 15 minutes late
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stick with $R$, a simple first approach
	\end{itemize}	
	\end{notes}
	
\end{annotation}

Your team decides that the mathematical object you will use to show the CEO that you solved or improved the problem is
\begin{itemize}
	\item $R=$ the sum in minutes by which every employee is late.
\end{itemize}

Note that employees that are on time count for 0 minutes (not a negative amount of minutes). \\

Create a mind map for the question: \quad How can $R$ be minimized?

\question
\label{elevator-assumptions}
Consider the elevator problem from question \ref{elevator-define}. 

We now give you some technical details about theBigCompany:


\begin{itemize}
	\item The company occupies the floors 30--33 of the building Place Ville-Marie (in Montr\'eal).

	\item Personnel is distributed in the following way: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 350 employees in floor 30,
		\item 350 employees in floor 31,
		\item 250 employees in floor 32, 
		\item 150 employees in floor 33.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textsl{Note.} Even though these details are fictional, the numbers respect the building code. \\

Focus on a \textbf{few} parameters and variables. State hypotheses.


\begin{annotation}
	\begin{notes}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Students usually have trouble starting. 
			\item They usually agree that they have to figure out how elevators work, so you can prompt them to be more specific. 
			
			\item In the end they should come up with questions like these:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item How fast are the elevators?
				\item How much time do elevators take in each floor?
				\item How many floors do elevators stop on their way up?
				\item How many people fit in the elevator?
				\item Should we consider elevator failures?
			\end{itemize}

\question

\begin{parts} 

	\item With your team, decide on what kind of information you would need to have to be able to solve this problem.

	\item Find the relevant information about the elevators (search the internet, by experimentation). Check the reliability of the data you found.

	\item For the relevant information that you cannot obtain, make assumptions. These assumptions should be reasonable and you should be able to justify them.

\question

Continuing on the elevator problem, let us think of this model for the problem.

\textbf{Facts:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Loading time of people at ground floor = 20 s
	\item Speed of uninterrupted ascent/descent = 1.5 floors/s
	\item Stop time at a floor = 7 s
	\item Number of elevators serving floors 30--33 = 8

	(these elevators serve floors 23-33 = 11 floors)
	
	\item Maximal capacity of elevators = 25 people
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Personnel that should start at time $t$, arrive uniformly in the interval $[t-30, t-5]$ in minutes
	\item First arrived, first served
	\item During morning rush hour, elevators don't stop on the way down
	\item Elevators stop only at half the floors they serve
	\item Elevator failures are neglected
	\item Mean number of people per floor is equal to the mean number of people per floor of the BigCompany
	\item Elevators are filled, in average, to 80\% of their capacity
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Model:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mean number of people per floor $= d = \dfrac{350+350+250+150}{4} = 275$ people / floor
	\item Number of people on floors served by elevators (11 floors) $= N = d \cdot 11 = 3025$ people
	\item Time $\Delta t$ of one trip

\hfil $\Delta t \quad = \quad $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{loading time on}\\\text{ground floor}}$} 
		$ \;+ \;$ \framebox{$\substack{\text{time of flight}\\\text{ground $\to 33$}}$}
		$ \;+\; $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{time of flight}\\\text{$33 \to$ ground}}$}
		$\;+\; $ \framebox{$\substack{\text{stop time to}\\\text{6 of the 11 floors}}$} $\quad = \quad$ 106 s
		
		\item Number of trips necessary per elevator $= n = \dfrac{3025}{20 \cdot 8} \approx 19$ trips

		\item Time necessary to carry the staff of the BigCompany $= \pmb{t} = \dfrac{19 \cdot 106}{60} = 33 $ minutes
\end{itemize}

\hfill \\

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{notes}

Some questions to guide the students:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the strengths?
	\item What are the weaknesses?
	\item Is the result around what you expected?
\end{itemize}	
	
\hfill \\
In case students don't realize that something is wrong:
\begin{itemize}
	\item People start arriving 30 minutes before the starting time, so \emph{everybody will be on time?}
	\item Assume that the CEO of the BigCompany is right: people are arriving late! What's wrong with the model?

	\item Which assumptions should be relaxed? Or checked?
	\item If one needs to be replaced, by what?
	\end{itemize}
	
	\end{notes}

Your task is to assess this model.
Be ready to report on your assessment.
