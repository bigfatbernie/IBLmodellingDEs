\question \label{pendulum}
	A pendulum is swinging side to side. We want to model its movement.

\begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
\begin{parts}
	\item Define the problem. Which function(s) do we want to find in the end?
	\item Build a mind map.
	\item Make assumptions. Remember to use your mind map to help structure the problem.
	\item Construct a model. You should end up with one (or more) differential equations. 
	
	Remember that there are some Physics principles that can help you (e.g. Newton's 2$^{\rm nd}$ Law, Conservation of Energy, Linear Momentum, and Angular Momentum, Rate of Change is Rate in $-$ Rate out).
	\item Assess your model:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find one test that your model passes.
		\item Find one test that your model fails.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{parts}

\begin{annotation}
	\begin{Goals}
		Students will mostly likely identify the goal as finding the position of the ball $\vec{r}(t) = \big( x(t) , y(t) \big)$. That's fine!
		
		Later, in Step 3, try to guide the students to recognize the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rope is massless (negligible)
			\item Rope doesn't bend (negligible)
			\item So can assume that the rope is rigid. How does that affect the position of the ball?
			\item No friction (negligible)
			\item \textbf{Important:} Students always focus on string tension. One can consider it, but it all cancels out. It's one of the exercises of the module (above). For the lecture, don't consider tension.
		\end{itemize}
		
		Then on Step 4, guide students to recognize that they actually only need to find a model for the angle, because the position of the ball really only depends on the angle $\theta(t): \vec{r}\big(\theta(t)\big)$
