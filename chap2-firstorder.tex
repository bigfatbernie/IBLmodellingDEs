	\Title{Slope Fields}

\Heading{Textbook}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Module 9
	\end{itemize}

\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sketch a slope field
		\item Use technology to create a slope field: WolframAlpha, Desmos, Geogebra, etc.
		\item Interpret a slope field
		\item Deduce properties of slope field from the ODE
		\item Deduce properties of solution from slope field
	\end{itemize}
	
\Heading{Motivation} 

ODEs are often difficult to solve, so we need tools to be able to interpret their solutions and deduce properties without having to solve them.

Slope fields are such a tool. 

Slope fields are not meant to be sketched by hand, so they shouldn't be asked to do that, except at the beginning to learn how they are sketched so they can understand them better. 

Slope fields should be used to help interpret solutions of ODEs.

	\Title{Approximating Solutions}


\Heading{Textbook}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Module 10
	\end{itemize}

\Heading{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Know the idea of Euler's method
		\item Use Euler's method
		\item Be aware of the limitations of Euler's method
		\item Deduce some properties of Euler's method
	\end{itemize}
	
\Heading{Motivation} 

After sketching slope fields and observing that they can be used to get an idea of the solution, the idea to use slope fields to rigorously define an approximation of the solution should come naturally.

Euler's method is just that approximation method. 

This is probably one of the most important tools for an Engineer or a Physicist studying Differential equations, since the ODEs that often arise naturally from real problems are too complicated to solve rigorously and approximating the solution might be the only way.

		\item Start modelling physical quantities
		\item Follow the procedure from chapter 1 when creating a model
	\end{itemize}
	
\Heading{Motivation} 

This is one of the main goals of this course. 

Students should be given the opportunity to create models in class. They should be encouraged to follow the procedure from chapter 1, as it will improve their models.


\Heading{Preparation for Class}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

	\begin{goals}
		Students will mostly likely identify the goal as finding the position of the ball $\vec{r}(t) = \big( x(t) , y(t) \big)$. That's fine!
		
		Later, in Step 3, try to guide the students to recognize the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Rope is massless (negligible)
			\item Rope doesn't bend (negligible)
			\item So can assume that the rope is rigid. How does that affect the position of the ball?
			\item No friction (negligible)
			\item \textbf{Important:} Students always focus on string tension. One can consider it, but it all cancels out. It's one of the exercises of the module (above). For the lecture, don't consider tension.
		\end{itemize}
		
		Then on Step 4, guide students to recognize that they actually only need to find a model for the angle, because the position of the ball really only depends on the angle $\theta(t): \vec{r}\big(\theta(t)\big)$ \\

		Students should finish it at home.

	Remember that there are some Physics principles that can help you (e.g. Newton's 2$^{\rm nd}$ Law, Conservation of Energy, Linear Momentum, and Angular Momentum, Rate of Change is Rate in $-$ Rate out).

\Heading{Motivation} 

This is the traditional class on differential equations. 

Even though the focus of the course is not on recipes for solving differential equations, when creating a model that involves a differential equation and analyzing it, it is necessary to be aware of some of the basic methods for solving them. 

Students should practice these methods more than the limited time devoted to them in lecture. Even though there aren't many practice problems, it is easy to find exercises for this module in any differential equations textbook.

	\end{itemize}
	
\Heading{Motivation} 

This is a little glimpse into the theory of Differential Equations. 

Knowing whether a differential equation has solutions, and whether there is one unique solution is important on its own right.

But even from a more applied point-of-view, these Theorems offer consequences to the behaviour of solutions of differential equations that make them very important. 

One of these properties is the fact that in the region in the $(t,y)$-plane where the Theorems' conditions are satisfied, solutions cannot intersect.

Even though nonlinear ODEs are in general very hard to study, Autonomous ODEs, which are often nonlinear, are an exception. 

These are ODEs of the form $y'=f(y)$, which can usually be thoroughly studied without having to find their solution. 

One of the key ways that we use to study Autonomous equations is to find equilibrium points and classify them as stable / unstable.
This will be extended to systems of ODEs.
